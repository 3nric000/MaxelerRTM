Timeout while waiting for a stream to finish.
Consult MaxDebug for more information about the status of your design.
MaxDebug can for example be used to check that no kernels are waiting for
data from inputs.  Alternatively, the value of timeouts can be altered by
way of the default_pcie_timeout variable of SLIC_CONF.
